# Did you start your function definition with def?
# Does your function name have only characters and _ (underscore) characters?
# Did you put an open parenthesis ( right after the function name?
# Did you put your arguments after the parenthesis ( separated by commas?
# Did you make each argument unique (meaning no duplicated names)?
# Did you put a close parenthesis and a colon ): after the arguments?
# Did you indent all lines of code you want in the function four spaces? No more, no less.
# Did you "end" your function by going back to writing with no indent (dedenting we call it)?

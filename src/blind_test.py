# blind test

# test section = 12 m x 2 m x 3 m
# rotor diameter = 0.894 m
# centre of the rotor is located at z = 0.817 m
#
# model was designed to operate at 10 m/s with a TSR = 6
#
# In order to test the Reynolds number dependence of the flow,
# the performance of the turbine was measured over a wide tip speed range
# for reference velocities ranging from about U_ref = 7-15 m/s.
#
# The power and thrust coefficients were found to be independent of Reynolds
# numbers for U_ref > 9 m/s
#
# participants provided profiles of:
#
# - velocity defecit: (U_ref - U) / U_ref
# - turbulent kinetic energy
#
# at 3 downstream positions, measured from the plane of the rotor:
#
# - x/d = 1
# - x/d = 3
# - x/d = 5
#
# the data was presented along a vertical and a horizontal line through the
# centre of the wake for 3 operating conditions:
#
# - TSR = 3
# - TSR = 6
# - TSR = 10
#
# a mi me importa el comportamiento del molino bajo condiciones normales, por
# lo tanto voy a estudiar unicamente velocity defect para TSR = 6 (estudio las
# 3 posiciones, x/d = 1,3,5)

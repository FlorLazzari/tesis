Undoubtedly development of the wind energy as one of
the primary clean sources is an inevitable way to achieve
sustainable and green energy supply. In this respect, off­
shore wind farms are rapidly getting bigger. Wind turbines
operating in a wind farm will be exposed to the wake influ­
ence of neighboring turbines. Wake behind a wind turbine
leads to a reduction of the mean wind speed and an
increase of turbulence level. Therefore in order to design
an optimum layout for a wind farm, the evaluation of the
wind turbine wake effect is essential because it leads to
high fatigue, which reduces significantly the turbine life­
time, and decreases the energy extraction for the down­
stream wind turbines. There are different approaches to
model the wind turbine wakes, from analytical models to
three-dimensional CFD rotor modeling. Today, most of the
site assessment CFD simulations are performed using com­
mercial packages like PHOENICS [2]. As an alternative to
those commercial packages, the open source CFD toolbox
OpenFOAM [1] is getting more important. Due to the open
source concept, the toolbox license is free of charge and
the free access to its source codes which gives the ability
for self-enhancing and extending the program, makes
OpenFOAM very interesting for wind farm developers.For
this work, OpenFOAM 2.1.1 has been used and all the
simulations were run in a workstation of 16 GB RAM quad
core Intel 3.4 GHz processor [4] and conducted through the
solver simpleFoam. Thrust is the only force applied on the
wind flow by the actuator disks and the atmospheric strati­
fication is assumed to be neutral throughout the project.
